    <ul>
      <li>1 (1 pound) loaf French baguette</li>
      <li>⅔ cup mayonnaise</li>
      <li>⅓ cup basil pesto</li>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat oven on broiler setting. Arrange bread slices in a single layer
        on a cookie sheet. Place under broiler for 5 to 8 minutes, or until
        lightly toasted on one side. Watch carefully to ensure they don't burn.
        Remove from oven, and flip bread slices so that the toasted side is on
        the bottom.
      </li>
      <li>
        Set the oven temperature for 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a small
        bowl, mix together mayonnaise, pesto, garlic, Parmesan and salt. Spread
        evenly over untoasted sides of bread slices.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven for 6 to 8 minutes. Set the oven to broil,
        and place the rounds under the broiler just until they begin to bubble
        and turn golden. Let cool slightly before serving.
